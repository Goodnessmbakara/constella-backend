# Aury MBTI Analysis

This module provides MBTI personality analysis based on text message data, converted from the original Swift iOS implementation.

## Overview

The Aury analyzer takes a collection of text messages and analyzes the user's texting patterns to determine their MBTI personality type, along with fun insights about their communication style.

## API Endpoints

### POST `/aury/analyze`

Analyzes message data and returns a complete MBTI personality profile.

**Request Body:**

    "error": null
}
```

### POST `/aury/validate-messages`

            "has_text": true,
            "contact": "John Doe"
        }
    ],
    "top_contacts": [
        ["John Doe", 45],
        ["Jane Smith", 32],
        ["Mom", 28]
    ]
}
```

### GET `/aury/health`

Health check endpoint.

**Response:**

```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "aury-analysis"
}
```

## Message Data Format

Each message should include:

-   `text` (string): The actual message content
-   `contact` (string): Name or identifier of the contact
-   `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp of when the message was sent
-   `is_from_me` (boolean): Whether the message was sent by the user being analyzed

## Analysis Requirements

For optimal analysis:

-   Minimum 100 messages recommended
-   At least 5 different contacts with substantial conversation history
-   Mix of different conversation types (casual, work, family, etc.)
-   Recent message data (within last 6-12 months) preferred

## Technical Details

-   Uses OpenAI's structured output for consistent response formatting
-   Implements conversation filtering to focus on meaningful exchanges
-   Analyzes conversation dynamics, response patterns, and communication style
-   Provides both humorous and insightful personality assessment

## Error Handling

The API returns errors gracefully in the response object rather than throwing HTTP exceptions, allowing clients to handle failures appropriately.

Common error scenarios:

-   No messages provided
-   Invalid message format
-   OpenAI API errors
-   Insufficient conversation data

## Example Usage

```python
import httpx

# Prepare message data
messages = [
    {
        "text": "Hey! How was your day?",
        "contact": "Best Friend",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-15T18:30:00Z",
        "is_from_me": True
    },
    # ... more messages
]

# Make request
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/aury/analyze",
        json={"messages": messages}
    )

    result = response.json()
    if result["success"]:
        profile = result["profile"]
        print(f"MBTI Type: {profile['mbti_type']}")
        print(f"Personality: {profile['personality_description']}")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
```
